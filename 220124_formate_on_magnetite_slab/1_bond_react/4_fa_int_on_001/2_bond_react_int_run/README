# After Formic acid deprotonation to Formate, excess hydrogen binds to the closest oxygen, but DFT calculations shows that this was not the case,

inorder to solve this discrepancy, formate molecule's center of mass was shifted to the neighbouring binding site to be consistant with DFT calculation.

For ease 2. and 3. part of this folders where taken from *tet* calculations so they are here to be a guide.
